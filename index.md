# Guglielmo Gattiglio



<img style="float: right;width:20%" src="assets/misc/photo_guglielmo.jpg">I am a third-year PhD student in the [Warwick Mathematics and Statistics CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/fromas) under the joint supervision of Prof. Lyudmila Grigoryeva and Prof. Massimiliano Tamborrino. My current research direction combines machine learning and parallel-in-time algorithms to solve differential equations numerically (Parareal). In the past, I have worked on the generation of stochastic processes and learning of dynamical systems, and computational methods for Bayesian inference.

The most recent version of my CV is available [here](https://guglielmogattiglio.github.io/assets/misc/Guglielmo_Gattiglio_CV.pdf).
